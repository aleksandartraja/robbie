## Bas Lijten

Bas Lijten is a Principal Architect at Achmea and Sitecore MVP with a very broad interest. He is responsible for the whole governance on the Sitecore platform at Achmea: Architecture principles, Development guidelines, all the roles and responsibilities, deployment, et cetera.

Parallel to the projects, he did a lot of research on integrating IoT with Sitecore, integrating Claims based authentication and other fun and complicated challenges. And because he works on a “need to share” basis, he shares all that information with the communities and product teams, because he believes that if you invest in others, in the end, you will get back more than double the investment.
