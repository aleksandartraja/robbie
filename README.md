# Robbie the Sitecore robot #

Robbie is a robot that moves, interacts, communicates and executes tasks, fully driven by Sitecore XP, using additional techniques like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Facial Recognisition & Emotion Detection powered by the Microsoft Cognitive Services API's.

## Why? ##

Because it's cool. And to showcase the power of Sitecore XP and experiment with profiling and interaction.

## Open Source ##

We will make the Robbie project fully Open Source, keep an eye out on this repository for the upcoming days!
